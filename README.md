## 🚧 Projects  

### Occluded Facial Expression Recognition (Real-World Conditions)
Developed a robust CNN-based model to recognize facial expressions even under:
- Partial occlusion (hands, hair, glasses, masks)  
- Poor lighting & low-resolution images  
- Side-angle and partially hidden faces  

Key contributions:
- Created a custom dataset with simulated occlusions  
- Built augmentation pipeline (blur, noise, shadow, occlusion masks)  
- Preprocessing workflow for difficult real-world scenarios  
- Fine-tuned model to improve robustness & accuracy  

Tech: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Data Augmentation, Deep Learning
